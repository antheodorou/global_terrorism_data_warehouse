# Global Terrorism Analysis
An analysis to more than 180,000 terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017 with R, Python, MSSQL and SSAS. First, an ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) phase was completed with R and Python, then with Microsoft SQL we performed more cleaning on the dataset and simultaneously we created the main database with all the appropriate relationships between the attributes of it. After created our star schema, we designed a cube in Microsoft Analysis Servises in Visual Studio and then we developped OLAP reports. Finally, we reported all the findings in Power BI, we created a report and a presentation containing the main points of all the above project. <br />
